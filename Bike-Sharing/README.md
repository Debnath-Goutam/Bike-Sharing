# Bike-Sharing
> BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider, is facing revenue loss due to the pandemic. They aim to boost post-lockdown demand by understanding the factors influencing bike-sharing needs. A consulting firm will analyze a dataset of daily bike demands to create a model that predicts demand based on various factors. This model will guide business strategies to meet customer expectations and understand new market dynamics.

## Conclusions
- The client should focus on Saturdays just as much as they focus on Weekdays.
- Special attention should be paid to the month of September, as it seems to be the only month that positively and significantly affects the number of users. Conversely, the month of July could benefit from promotional marketing to counter the decrease in demand.
- The business is growing positively after the COVID-19 pandemic, as seen in the rise of customer usage.
- Rainy and/or snowy days have relatively less demand, which could be used for maintainence services.
